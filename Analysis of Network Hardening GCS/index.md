### Security risk assessment report 
A social media organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
1.	The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2.	The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3.	The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4.	Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

### Part 1
Task: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement.

Password policies
Firewall maintenance
Multifactor authentication


### Part 2
Task: Explain your recommendations.

The company has four vulnerabilities:
1.	The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2.	The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3.	The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4.	Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
Two of these speak to insecure password practices, namely the sharing of passwords and using the default admin password for the database. Password policies make it more difficult to brute force passwords, usually by setting minimum standards for password length, complexity and uniqueness.

To more effectively make use of the organization’s firewalls, it is important to carry out regularly firewall maintenance to implement and update firewall rules, especially with what has been learned in the post-analysis in the aftermath of the data breach. 

Multifactor authentication also improves protection against brute force attacks, by adding at least one other verification step in addition to a password. This can be as simple as receiving one-time pin in an authenticator app.
