SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations

Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.

Scope:
•	Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
•	Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
•	Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
•	Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
•	Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.

Goals:
•	To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) 
•	Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant 
•	Fortify system controls
•	Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management 
•	Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks 
•	Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

Critical findings (must be addressed immediately):
Administrative Controls
•	Least privilege
•	Disaster recovery plans
•	Password policies
•	Access control policies
•	Account management policies
•	Separation of duties

Technical Controls
•	Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
•	Encryption
•	Backups
•	Password management system
•	Antivirus (AV) software

Physical Controls
•	Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance
•	Locking cabinets (for network gear)
•	Locks
•	Fire detection and prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.)

Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need): 
•	Manual monitoring
•	Adequate lighting
•	Signage indicating alarm service providers

Summary/Recommendations: 
There are a number of critical findings which should be addressed immediately, mostly around controlling access to hardware and software, as well as ensuring business continuity. Less urgent are the implementation of physical deterrents to discourage would-be attackers.
