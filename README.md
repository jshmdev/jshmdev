Hi there

I currently hold A+ and N+, and I am working towards Security+. Although I come from a communications background and still do about 50% marketing work, 50% is govtech, deploying, securing and maintaining applications to Azure IAAS, PAAS and SAAS environments, as well as low-code and no-code applications on Microsoft Power Platform. I am most interested in communication, security and data science and I use these skills everyday.

- Iâ€™m currently working on a thousand change requests to improve the security and performance of the applications I work on.
- Iâ€™m currently conducting a research project on how to measure cybersecurity awareness so we can develop more effective training methods and materials. As the majority of cybersecurity breaches rely on user error (induced or otherwise) so every degree of improvement represents a huge opportunity.
