Hi there

I am working toward a more technical role after 8 years working 50-50 split between technical and non-technical functions in a specialist digital marketing role where I also deploy, secure and maintain web applications and cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure PaaS and SaaS clouds as well as low- and no-code applications in Power Platform. My key areas of interest are communication, security and data science.

- I hold the following certifications: A+, N+ and Google IT Support Professional.
- I'm working the following certifications: Security+ and Google Cybersecurity Professional.
- I'm broadening my commercial knowledge with a postgraduate diploma in management, where my research project is on the influence of cybersecurity awareness training on security posture in an organisation.
- Iâ€™m currently working on a thousand change requests to improve the security and performance of the applications I work on.
- Iâ€™m currently conducting a research project on how to measure cybersecurity awareness so we can develop more effective training methods and materials. As the majority of cybersecurity breaches rely on user error (induced or otherwise) so every degree of improvement represents a huge opportunity.

Feel free to take a look around.
