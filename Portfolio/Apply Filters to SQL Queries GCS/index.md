Project description:
Using SQL, the cybersecurity analyst investigates potential security issues by examining organisational data in the employees and log_in_attempts tables using SQL filters.
Retrieve after hours failed login attempts 
To investigate a potential security incident that occurred after business hours, the analyst queried the log_in_attempts table and review after hours login activity, using SQL filters to create a query that identifies all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00.

### Retrieve login attempts on specific dates

To investigate a suspicious event which occurred on 2022-05-09, the analyst reviewed all login attempts that occurred on this day and the day before using SQL filters to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. 

Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
 
To investigate suspicious activity with login attempts that originated outside Mexico, the analyst investigated login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico using SQL filters to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico, including the full country name and abbreviations.

Retrieve employees in Marketing
 
To allow the team to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department, the analyst created a query that identifies all employees in the Marketing department for all offices in the East building.

Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
 
To allow the team to perform a different security update on machines for employees in the Sales and Finance departments, the analyst used SQL filters to create a query that identifies all employees in either the Sales or Finance departments.

Retrieve all employees not in IT
 
To allow the team to make an update to employee machines outside of the Information Technology department, the analyst used used SQL filters to create a query which identifies all employees not in the IT department.

Summary
Using filters in SQL allows analysts and the teams they are part of to complete a number of cybersecurity tasks with specific criteria, selecting individuals, machines and incidents that meet various criteria for further action.
