Permission are displayed as a 10-character string that denotes whether the file is a standard file or a directory, as well as whether the user, group and other are permitted to read, write and/or execute. The string takes the format drwxrwxrwx, with the three rwx groups d denoting ‘directory’ or dash for file, and r denoting ‘read’, w denoting ‘write’ x denoting ‘execute’ and dash for none for each of the three user types. Dashes in the permissions string indicate none.
